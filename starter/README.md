# MyReads Project

This is a web application for tracking books, which shows three shelves-

- Currently Reading
- Want To Read
- Read

There is also a search page that allows the user to look for new books. The user can also add/remove/change the shelf of a book.

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
